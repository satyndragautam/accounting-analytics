# Accounting Analytics


As my curiosity leads me to learn something new, I regularly crave ways to educate and improve myself. While still enjoying parenting with my first-born, I made sure to add new skills and improve existing ones. So, I decided to take on a new challenge and enroll in a certification program in accounting analytics, designed to provide fundamental knowledge in Accounting.

Throughout this project, I actively engaged in learning from basic to core accounting structures. This endeavor not only provided me with an opportunity to learn about accounting but also guided me on how to apply this skill in real-life scenarios with real-life datasets. For example, on a practical level, I created a concrete financial plan for our family, tracked unnecessary expenses, and eliminated them, resulting in better savings.

Moreover, this course provided me with comprehensive knowledge and skills, enabling me to draw actionable insights from raw datasets. I gained proficiency in Financial Statements Analysis and Reporting, Ratio Analysis, Common-size Statements, Pro Pharma Statements, Accounting-Based Valuation, Earnings Management, Fraud Prediction Models, and linking Non-Financial KPIs to Financial KPIs.

In the end, I successfully developed a deep understanding of how to effectively communicate with accounting data and present invaluable insights to end-users.

Please Note: During this program, there were multiple exercises and projects done using speadsheets. I will add them here in this repo for a better visibility in upcoming months.
